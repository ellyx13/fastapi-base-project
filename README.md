# FastAPI Base Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the FastAPI Base Project! This foundational template is designed for building API services using FastAPI, MongoDB, and Docker. It provides a robust starting point with functionalities for user management, task handling, authentication, and authorization.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: Utilizes FastAPI for high-performance, asynchronous APIs with automatic interactive documentation (Swagger UI).
- **MongoDB**: Uses MongoDB as the NoSQL database, ensuring flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Docker**: Simplifies development, deployment, and scaling through containerization.
- **CRUD User Management**: Includes complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for user management.
- **Task Module**: Features a module for creating, updating, and tracking tasks.
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - **Two User Roles**: Supports 'user' and 'admin' roles with different levels of access.
  - **Secure Authentication**: Implements secure authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
  - **Role-Based Authorization**: Ensures that users can only access data relevant to them and perform allowed actions. Admins have unrestricted access to all operations and data.
